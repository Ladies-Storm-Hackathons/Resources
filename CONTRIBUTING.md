# Contributing

If you have any ideas/updates/things you find useful, please
[fork](https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/Resources), commit your
changes, and open up a PR (you'll need to select "compare across forks").

If you don't know how to use Git but still want to contribute, the Pencil Edit
icon allows you to edit a file and submit a PR all through the web interface.
Alternatively, open up an issue, or send me an email via
[aliceyoung.9@gmail.com](aliceyoung.9@gmail.com). Another option would be to
check out our
[Git Resources](https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/Resources#git).

I will not merge any PR with compiled lists of female engineers (mentor lists,
etc.), because this is a publicly accessible repository and there's no way to
both keep the list open to people who need the list AND out of the hands of Bad
Actors.

## Style Guide

I like keeping lines at 80 characters max. The frequent exception will be lines
that have to contain long URL's.

## Code of Conduct

We use and enforce the
[Contributor Covenant, v1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/). To
report violations, email [aliceyoung.9@gmail.com](aliceyoung.9@gmail.com), the
maintainer.
